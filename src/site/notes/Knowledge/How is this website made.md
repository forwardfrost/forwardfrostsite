This site is published from an obsidian repository. 

It is generated from a template project over on https://dg-docs.ole.dev
In particular we followed along with the [Wanderloots tutorial](https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/tutorials/how-to-publish-obsidian-notes-website-for-free-digital-garden-or-blog/) on the subject!

It's a pretty nifty way to make a deployed obsidian repo and has an added benefit over other solutions in that it compiles and thus supports dataview queries!
